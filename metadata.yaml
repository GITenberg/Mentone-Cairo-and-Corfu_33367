description: A distant relative of the great American writer James Fenimore Cooper,
  Constance Fenimore Woolson emerged as an important female literary figure in the
  late-nineteenth century. In this fascinating volume, she recounts her extensive
  travels, offering readers a glimpse into a different era -- as well as the life
  of an independent woman during a time when those who took such liberties were often
  frowned upon.
